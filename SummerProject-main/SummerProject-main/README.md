# Qi-CT for Early Cancer Detection With AI and Holistic Healthcare

# Description

The current cancer screening process is insufficient in detecting cancer at an early stage, leading to more challenging prognosis and treatment outcomes. To combat this, we built the web application Qi-CT which uses embedded AI to calculate an individual's cancer risk based on symptoms and risk factors. In addition to the lack of early cancer screening, there is a critical gap in nutritional and physical advice during patient care. Qi-CT addresses this by providing a holistic approach that includes telehealth services and personalised lifestyle support. This report presents a literature review of the existing practices and identifies solutions aimed at improving patient outcomes. We propose a new application designed for use by patients, doctors and nutritionists and discuss its implementation. Throughout development, we also conducted user testing and evaluations to ensure Qi-CT meets its intended requirements. Whilst the application is yet to be deployed, it offers a promising solution to work alongside current cancer screening processes to increase the number of early diagnoses.

## Aim
Aid early cancer diagnosis globally by using an AI tool to predict an individual's cancer risk from symptoms and risk factors. Following diagnosis, support patients with tailored meal and exercise plans to complement their treatment. 

## Objectives
1. Create an AI cancer prediction tool based on patient-reported symptoms and risk factors.
2. Integrate telehealth to connect patients and doctors.
3. Create alternative lifestyle guidance for cancer patients undergoing treatment.
